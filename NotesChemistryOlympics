Active part to make dat world better, smallest points philosophy!

Day 16.

(xChemistryOlympics)Might be golden. Kinda mistake in de later hours what is it (More than once?)+)We are not doing 10 tasks at a time, lets do 1!
(xChemistryOlympics)Chemistry learning way dat examination is providing what is it?)+) We do simply read de result and do learn out of it for de future tasks
(xChemistryOlympics)What do metalls never do (Kinda kislo?)+) Metalls do never do okislitelnie svoistva
(xChemistryOlympics)How do we call rows in de pereodic table according to de Mendeleev? (Hockey got it))+) We do call it periods
(xChemistryOlympics)How do we call de columns in de pereodic table according to de Mendeleev? (Kinda what)+) We do call it de groups
(xChemistryOlympics)6 metalls from de group 1 how do we call them for de water reactions (Kinda lie in de end and vodka at start)+) Alkali
(xChemistryOlympics)What do groups have (Kinda like in de real-life)?)+)Same properties of de elements like de reaction with smth, might be few columns!
(xChemistryOlympics)What are de rows about(Kinda about de shells)?)+) Rows are about de electron shells, when de row ends shell is fullfilled
(xChemistryOlympics)Try to name 6 elements of de first row metals alkali?(LIT, soda, pota, rubin, cesar, France idk))+) Lithium, Sodium, Potassium, Rubidium, Cesium, Francium
(xChemistryOlympics)So we are gonna learn more easily with de help of what(Opposite usage we did think about before?)+) Periodic table
(xChemistryOlympics)How do we call de losing state of de electrons? (Oxi starting point)+) Oxidation
(xChemistryOlympics)How do we call de gaining state of de electrons? (Kinda opposite to gain)+) Reduction
(xChemistryOlympics)On de other side less electrons make it more positive is it (Dat is why it is called reduction, reduction is negative then?)+) Seems so

Day17.

(xChemistryOlympics)Transition metals in de center of de table what is it (About de Reaction with de water opposite to de Column 1 group, about de oxydation (Kinda same as de reaction with de water)?)+)Reactions are limited to 0 or very slow both! With de water no reactions usually

Day2.
(xChemistryTop)What do we do with de formulla to oxidate? (Kinda sum of elements going into))+)It goes into de parts (Divide de formula into de smaller formulas) Divide into molecules to do better
(xChemistryTop)Formulas and Equations are so good why (Practically efficiency)?)+)No need to learn a lot of info around, formula is on a good point!
(xChemistryTop)What it looks like first view? It looks like de stronger element going into de what? (Kinda animal's laws) might be golden might be golden kinda)+)Solid state not sure IF ANIMALS ASSOCIATION WORKS IT IS GOLDEN
(xChemistryTop)Metal n1 needs he says why do we not sleep on it(10cm problem? Swedish Thore)+)Every problem might be smth about de human nature, Thorium is a problem cuz of de high radiactivity lvl 10cm range, another range is okey says de lector
(xChemistryTop)Oxidation agent / Reducing agent what is it?)+)1 giving electrons becoming PLUS (open for offer OR closed for de offer) 2nd receiving electrons got no space for offer says kinda minus NO

(xChemistryTop)What might be de way to save de ppz of de atomic war?(Kinda feeling, kinda we are focusin it daily well after de slower thinking addition))+)It did show de electron way or de planet's angel
(xChemistryTop)Why is it more interesting to reade or to watch 2nd time?(Kinda another lvl of de reactions))+)It is about de brain stupid reactions kinda
(xChemistryTop)Word for de oxidation-reduction reaction (Kinda regex)?)+) It is about de redox reaction!
(xChemistryTop)About de charge reduction right association lies at what spot(Positive particles)?)+)Protons decrease while gaining electrons de charge! So giving de negative makes you more positive kinda
(xChemistryTop)How do we understand where de charge goes and de more active reacion happens(About de not groups?)+)About de periods it is about
(xChemistryTop)How are we gonna check about de explosions(About de periods check)?)+)Explosions are making de more active reactions with de weights break may be i dont know de idea if one side wanna receive and de another part to GAIN
(xChemistryTop)Practical oxygen what is it(Kinda always double?)+)It is double minus so it is ready to gain! (Need to understand why strange letters)
(xChemistryTop)Interesting letters on de shell lvls what is it?(Kinda 3 letters or more(I need to know more about super pidor diagram Seems shells are not odnorodni hmmmm or SMTH else cuz it is electron shells anyway)))+)s s s s s s p p p p p d d d d d
(xChemistryTop)I guess neutral state of de molecule what is it(Kinda stable)?)+) It is about de charges balances for example CO2, because de Oxygen always got de -2 and 2 atoms of it in de stable connection it is gonna be +4 Carbon to have a balance 
(xChemistryTop)What about de popular another element vodorod?(Hydrogen))+)It is always (kinda 99% i guess in practise) +1
(xChemistryTop)So in de general speaking what de +1 means (Kinda protons missing de friend)+)Ye it means positively charged proton got no friend i guess recheck
(xChemistryTop)Is de element oxygen 0 state without de reaction with de friend?)+) Yes it is 0 charges solo!
(xChemistryTop)Another general speaking de connections are what? (Kinda not complete union - VERY STRUCTURED UNION)+) It is about de union on de lvl of de last (mb not recheck) electron shell
(xChemistryTop)Might be golden tip about what in de union? MIGHE BE GOLDEN CUZ OF DE UNIVERSE SMALLER POINTS LVL GOLDEN GOLDEN GOLDEN GOLDEN GOLDEN enjoy de formulas (Swift got dat starting s kinda truck)+) It is about de structures of de connection CONNECTIONS MIGHT BE DE ANOTHER COOL SMALL POINTS UNIVERSE

(xChemistryTop)Might be de good reality physics law not sure (About dat woman said to us Nature word)+)It is about de Natural resistance - everything we do touch try to go to de 0 energy poing
(xChemistryTop)Is it possibly de way errors do born?Might be golden golden golden golden(About de natural 0 poing of energy))+)Might be need to think about it
(xChemistryTop)3 steps of de reaction how do we do it(Oxi + not letters , kinda 50%, kinda dzen?)+)We do call it Oxidation numbers, than we do Half reactions after we do de balance
(xChemistryTop)How do we call de equilibrium point what do we mean?(Kinda about de woman first chemist study))+)It is about de point of 0 energy everything trying to achieve in any reaction!
(xChemistryTop)Might be super super super golden point what?(About de hardest knowledge))+)Kinda easy study may be possible dat way associations to de structure,  to use de hardest practical knowledge for de memory fragments weaker point
(xChemistryTop)What is it gonna be de previous point what is it possible to create with dat?)+)We do create de treees may be dat point is de first double GOlden one, after de memory kinda
