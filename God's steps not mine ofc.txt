God formulas steps = effective learning (Should be possible to focus precise things to BE PRECISE in de algoths and things)

Day0.

1.Current Formula what is it?)+)It is resistor R R R R R multiplied (Summ of resitors) de napryazheny U U U U U 

Day1.
2.(Kinda A A A A A)Rabota how to measture?)+)Work is de F F F F F multiplied to de distance s s s s s 
3.(SilaToka different I I I I I) how to measure(Solo Concentration)?)+)One zaryad charge q q q q q multiplied by concentration 1 cubik meter n n n n n miltiply area S S S S S multiplied skorost v v v v v dreifovaya skorost
4.(Mol' n n n n n)Kinda 24 hours under - always put it to de equation)+) Equation is mass of de chemical divided with de 24g/mol' (or de number of de mass of de pereodic table)
5.(Volume of de moles measure V V V V V)1 constant kinda hours i do not sleep and what else?)+) molyarnii obiem n n n n n multiplied by de 22.4 l/mol'
6.(Area formula triangle and de circle) S S S S S equals Perimeter P P P P P multiplied with de r r r r r figure inside divided by 2
7.(Formula of de PRESSURE, not de resistor )  p p p p p equals to kolvo MOLYARNOE n n n n n (or small v) (((it is m m m m m real divided with de M M M M M mol' mass))) multiplied with de R R R R R constant multiplied Thermo Temperature division with de VOLUME! 
8.(AH absolute humidity formula)+)mass of the water vapor m m m m m divide by de whole volume V V V V V 
9.(Angle of de fall formula what is it?(Ugol Padeniya epic easy))+) Ugol Padeniya = Uglu Otrazheniya
10.(Parallel connection RESISTOR VALUES what is it?(WORLD UPSIDE DOWN))+) 1 divide R(all) equals 1 divide R(one) plus 1 division R(two)
11.(TRUE POWER OF DE bulb (What is it? OFC counter force in 2 things up)+) P P P P P equals to napryazhenie U U U U U (squared) division with de (summ of de resists) R R R R R
12.(p p p p p (about MAMA and Vanya)+)It is about de m m m m m division with de V V V V V
13.(Rule about funny associations here what is it(Kinda order of de objects)?)+)First gonna be on de head of de formula
